Application starts at hub level, where player can select level what he/she want to visit. As said, it can be one of minigames or relaxation levels.

Flying around beautiful nature landscape under restful accompaniment is very relaxing, so, as planned, this game will reduce anxiety and therefore pain.

For example, it can be night forest location with dark starry sky and warm campfire near you. You sit on a log, looking at fire or stars and hear quiet sound of a fire and chirping of crickets. Sounds relaxing, isn’t it?
